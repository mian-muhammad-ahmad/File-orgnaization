File Organizer & Sorting Algorithm Performance Analyzer

Developed by Muhammad Ahmad

Project Description

The File Organizer and Sorting Algorithm Performance Analyzer is a software application that organizes file data—either file names (strings) or file sizes (integers)—and evaluates the performance of four sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

It measures execution time, number of comparisons, and number of swaps, providing a clear comparison of algorithm efficiency. This project is ideal for learning algorithm behavior, performance analysis, and data organization techniques.

Features

Accepts file names or file sizes as input

Implements four sorting algorithms

Tracks and displays:

Execution time

Number of comparisons

Number of swaps

Displays results in tables and charts (for web version)

Clean, user-friendly interface

Installation & Setup

No backend required for basic functionality

Usage

Select input type: File Names or File Sizes

Enter the number of items (20–200 recommended)

Input your data

Run the sorting algorithms to view:

Sorted results

Comparisons, swaps, and execution time for each algorithm

Sorting Algorithms Implemented

Selection Sort – Simple comparison-based sorting

Insertion Sort – Stable sort, efficient for small datasets

Quick Sort – Divide-and-conquer, efficient for larger datasets

Heap Sort – Uses heap data structure for sorting


Future Enhancements

Step-by-step sorting animations

File upload support (.txt or .csv)

Export results as CSV or PDF

Responsive web interface improvements

Dark/light mode toggle
